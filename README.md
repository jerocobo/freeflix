# freeFlix
Watch movies with this simple Python client(only for OSX, can be easily modified to work on WIndows too). 

To get started, simply download the repo, navigate to the folder via terminal and run these commands:

<i>python get-pip.py </i>

<i>pip install selenium </i>

<i>pip install rottentomatoes </i>


and you should be all set

(Note that, you need to have to have VLC installed on your machine to stream this)

Now, the fun part,

run this command in your terminal

<i>python freeFlix.py skyfall </i>


and you should get a VLC window playing skyfall.

For other movies, simple replace skyfall with that movie name eg 
<i>python freeflix.py the dark knight </i>


<b> Also you can add subtitles easily to the streaming movie </b>

go to subscene.com and find the subtitle of that movie, download it, extract it and drag it to the player
