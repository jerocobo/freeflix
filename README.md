# freeFlix
Watch movies with this simple Python client(only for OSX, can be easily modified to work on WIndows too). 

To get started, simply download the repo, navigate to the folder via terminal and run these commands:

python get-pip.py
pip install selenium
pip install rottentomatoes

and you should be all set

(Note that, you need to have to have VLC installed on your machine to stream this)

Now, the fun part,

run this command in your terminal

python freeFlix.py skyfall

and you should get a VLC window playing skyfall.

For other movies, simple replace skyfall with that movie name separated by dashes eg the-dark-knight-rises.
